# Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn rate is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. Predicting churn enables organizations to identify dissatisfied customers early, understand the underlying causes, and take proactive steps to improve retention. These insights help uncover weaknesses in products, pricing strategies, operational processes, and overall customer experience.

This project focuses on designing and implementing a machine learning–based workflow to predict customer churn effectively.

## Churn Prediction Workflow

The development process includes the following key stages:

### 1. Problem Definition and Goal Setting
Clearly defining the problem is the foundation of the project. This involves:
- Understanding business objectives
- Identifying stakeholder expectations
- Defining what insights are needed from churn prediction

### 2. Data Source Identification
Selecting the right data sources is crucial for accurate predictions. Common sources of churn-related data include:
- CRM systems
- Customer analytics platforms
- Customer feedback and support data

### 3. Data Preparation and Exploration
Raw data must be transformed into a machine-learning-ready format. This stage includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection

High-quality data at this stage significantly improves model performance.

### 4. Modeling and Evaluation
Multiple machine learning models are trained and tested to identify the most effective approach. This phase focuses on:
- Model training
- Performance evaluation
- Validation using appropriate metrics

### 5. Deployment and Monitoring
The best-performing model is deployed into production. Deployment options include:
- Integration into existing business systems
- Serving predictions via a standalone application

Continuous monitoring ensures the model remains accurate and reliable over time.
